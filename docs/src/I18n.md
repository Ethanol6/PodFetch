## Internationalization

Podfetch is available in multiple languages.
If you want to add a new language you can do so by adding a new file to the`i18n` folder and adding the translations 
to the file. The file should be named after the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
language code. For example `en.json` for English or `de.json` for German.

If you want to add a new language, please take a look at this [file](https://github.com/SamTV12345/PodFetch/blob/main/ui/src/language/json/en.json) to see which translations are required.
You only need to add the translations for the values.
